DESCRIPTION : A File Handling Utility in Java is a simple and practical program designed to perform basic operations on text files, such as reading, writing, and modifying content. It helps users interact with file systems through a console or graphical interface, making it easier to manage file data directly from a Java application. Purposes is the main goal of this utility is to allow users to:
Read contents of a file and display it on the screen.
Write new data to a file (either by appending or overwriting).
Modify specific content within a file, such as replacing words or lines.
1. Read File:
Opens a specified text file and reads its content line by line using BufferedReader, displaying the content in the console.
2. Write to File:
Allows the user to input text and either append it to the existing file or overwrite it using BufferedWriter and FileWriter.
3. Modify File:
Searches the file for a specific word or phrase and replaces it with new text. This is done by reading the file content into memory, making changes, and then writing the updated content back to the file.
This utility provides hands-on experience with Java file operations and is ideal for understanding how to manage file input/output efficiently in Java.
